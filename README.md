# COSC2759 Assignment 1
## AirBNB Clone
- Full Name/Names: Michael Mountjoy**

## 1. Overview 
This readme.md file will explain how to setup this project through React. It will show the installation,
deployment, and termination processes involved in managing the web application. The project is a reconstructed clone
of AirBNB. Scrimba helped me create this in a tutorial series.

## 2. Prerequisites 
- Python 3.1+
- Node v17.6.0+
- NPM 9.5.1 
- Text Editor
- Access to the code repository

## 3. Setup
In this phase, a walkthrough will be provided on how to set up the repository.
If there are any missing dependencies, simply follow the console prompts and use:

`npm install `

This will grab the required dependancies from the package.json file and install
it to the local host. This allows the server to be run using the necessary
dependencies.

Run this to start the server:

`npm run build `

Right click index.html and run. The server should appear in your browser and should be viewable.

## 4. Troubleshooting
If any merge or commit issues occur pushing a commit, then use the merge editor to troubleshoot it.+

Above is a picture of how the merge editor looks like. Incoming changes are either
integrated or rejected into the existing codebase. Once these issues are resolved,
it should be possible to merge the branch in question or re-commit.

Run:

`npm audit fix` 

to fix any errors associated with installation.
